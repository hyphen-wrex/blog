  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Ivan. I like philosophy and improving myself.
    Believer in the bright future for our society. Believer that we need to work
    hard for this though. Already doing the latter.
  </p>
  <h1>About this blog</h1>
  <p>
    This blog was conceived from idea of writing a book. A book called
    "Modern Philosophy". But there are some challenges with that.
    My writing skills are weak and I don't have the idea of a solid structure for
    the book. Just have a lot of thoughts, a lot of scattered everywhere uncompleted articles.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Writing this blog adresses both of issues. My writing skills will improve overtime. 
    I will have 80% of thoughtbase laid out in the blog posts. The structure for the book will come 
    naturally after that. 
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    I invite you to comment and discuss every problem and idea I touch in blog posts. The truth 
    is then will be born in discussions.

    Welcome aboard, summoner!
