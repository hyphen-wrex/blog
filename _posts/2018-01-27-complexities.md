There are hidden complexities in our everyday life. And most of the time we don't even notice them.
It would be profitable if we can spot them. That would give us the perspective on what to change in 
order to make the process go easier. 
Here I present my couple of points to consider.
# The field of options problem
If you experience the field of options problem you have really hard time doing something. Because you
don't know where to start due to enormous possibilities for action.

Have you tried writing a book? You might have experienced the field of options problem. You don't know
where to start. You don't know what to write. You have this idea, that idea - lots of them.

Here we're restrained by platform limits.

# Cognitive load
When you try to hold a lot of items in your consciousness - you'll have not much left space for thinking
and the difficulty of it will grow enormously.

Ever tried to multiply 689 by 654 in your head? You'll experience cognitive overloading. And the solution
is to just write down the numbers. You just incrementally add more information to the table. Until
you solve the puzzle entirely. 

Again, we're restrained by platform limits.

# Procrastination
All of us have experienced this. You have hard time doing something, because you're already doing something
more pleasant. This problem is harder than previous ones because it is your problem. The problem of
consciousness itself. And those sets of problems are the most difficult ones to solve. We'll talk about
this later.

Just need to choose correctly, efficiently and stick to your choice. When you stick to your choice long
enough - your brain, your neurons will reform to support you. This would be much easier then.

We're restrained by ourselves.

# Efficiency metrics
Despite having me said that first two points are of platform limits nature - it is necessary to 
mention that you can also improve on those. You can improve your brain so that it would be better
suited to work with those structures. The point is - it would be less efficient. Less efficient 
than to just use a piece of paper to write down those numbers in the multiplication problem. 

Improve those brain structures, I believe, is extremely domain specific and, thus, inefficient. If you
decide to improve yourself - better improve your consciousness. If you'll conquer the procrastination
problem - you'll gain a lot more, immensely more than if you'd conquer the cognitive load problem.

# To do 
- write about consciousness problems, problem of choice
- write about my understanding of how neurons are working, the rule of repetition
- write about platform and what I mean by that
- add chart to prove the point about metrics
